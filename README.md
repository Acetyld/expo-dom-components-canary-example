# Experimental DOM Components with Expo canary

This project demonstrates how to use experimental [DOM components](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/dom-components/) with Expo canary.

Your best bet is to use dev clients (`npx expo run`), but you can also try running this in Expo Go but YMMV until Expo SDK 52 is released.
